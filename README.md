# üêç Usage

## ‚õìÔ∏è Workflow Node
![Illustration](docs/assets/workflow2.png)

 - Load a workflow in **workflows** list. This field will show all workflows saved in the comfyui user folder: **ComfyUI\user\default\workflows\api**, if you add a new workflow in this folder you have to refresh UI (F5 to refresh web page) to see it in the **workflows** list.
 - Workflows have to be saved as **API format** of comfyui, but save it also in normal format because "api formal file" can't be loaded in comfyui as usually.

 <img src="docs/assets/save_as_api.png">

If you don't see **"Export (API format)"** options in Comfyui do this :
 - go to Settings
 - Activate the **Dev Mode** options

![Illustration](docs/assets/devmode.png)

-You can also Import the file by "copy/paste" your workflow path in "workflow_api_path" and click import, that will add your workflow in the comfyui api path.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Input Node
![Illustration](docs/assets/input2.png)

- Allow to declare inputs in your workflow.
- Types available :  **"IMAGE", "MASK", "STRING", "INT", "FLOAT", "LATENT", "BOOLEAN", "CLIP", "CONDITIONING", "MODEL", "VAE"**
- Give a Name and select the type.
- **Default** value is used when debugging your workflow or if you don't plug an input into the **Workflow** node.

- ![Illustration](docs/assets/workflow5.png)

## ‚õìÔ∏è Output Node
![Illustration](docs/assets/output1.png)

- Allow to declare outputs in your workflow.
- Types available :  **"IMAGE", "MASK", "STRING", "INT", "FLOAT", "LATENT", "BOOLEAN", "CLIP", "CONDITIONING", "MODEL", "VAE"**
- Give a Name and select the type.
- **Default** value is used to connect the output.

![Illustration](docs/assets/output2.png)

## ‚õìÔ∏è Continue Node
![Illustration](docs/assets/continue1.png)

- Usually associated with a **boolean** input plugged on **"continue_workflow"**, allow to "Stop" a workflow if **"continue_workflow"** is False.
- Types available :  **"IMAGE", "LATENT"**
- Give a Name and select the type.
- During development of your workflow, If **continue_worflow" is False it will let pass only 1 image/latent, and if True it will let pass all images/latents.

![Illustration](docs/assets/continue3.png)

- But When a workflow is loaded into the **"workflow"** Node, which contain a **"Workflow Continue"** node, it will be delete if **continue_workflow** is False. That allow to create conditional situation where you want to prevent computation of some parts.

## üîâüëÑ Workflow LipSync Node
![Illustration](docs/assets/lipsync2.png)

- Extra Node that allow to use third-party app **[Lipsync Studio v0.6](https://www.patreon.com/Wav2LipStudio)** Via it's API
- Inputs:
    - **frames**: Images to compute.
    - **audio**: Audio to add.
    - **faceswap_image**: An image with a face to swap.
    - **lipsync_studio_url**: usually http://127.0.0.1:7860
    - **project_name**: name of your project.
    - **face_id**: id of the face you want to lipsync and faceswap.
    - **fps**: frame per second.
    - **avatar**: Will be used create a driving video, 10 avatars are available, each give different output result.
    - **close mouth before Lip sync**: Allow to close the mouth before create the lip sync.
    - **quality**: Can be **Low, Medium, High**, in High gfpgan will be used to enhance quality output.
    - **skip_first_frame**: number of frames to remove at the beginning of the video.
    - **load_cap**: number of frames to load.
    - **low vram**: allow to decrease VRAM consumption for low pc configuration.

Project will be automatically created into your Lipsync Studio **projects** folder. You can then load it into studio and work directly from studio if the output not good enough for you.

## üí™ Special things to know

 the **"ü™õ Switch"** nodes from [Crystools](https://github.com/crystian/ComfyUI-Crystools) have a particular place in **workflow Node**

![Illustration](docs/assets/crystools.png)

Let's illustrate this with an example:

![Illustration](docs/assets/switch.png)

Here we want to choose between video1 or video2. It depends on the **boolean** value in **Switch Image Node**. The issue here is that both videos will be loaded before Switch. To prevent both videos from being loaded, the **"workflow node"** will check the boolean value, remove the unused node, and directly connect the correct value to the preview image.

![Illustration](docs/assets/switch2.png)

This gives you the ability to create truly conditional cases in your workflows, without computing irrelevant nodes.
